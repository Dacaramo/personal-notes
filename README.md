# Personal notes

![Funny image](./assets/dearDiary.png)
This is a repository for sharing my .md notes between all my devices. This is a public repository so feel free to read all of my personal notes regarding software development. This is the outcome of reading and understanding a fair amount of official documentation, handy developer's blogs and watching courses and tutorials.
