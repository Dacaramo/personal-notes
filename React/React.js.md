# React

## Create app using Vite

Using **Vite** for creating an app is much faster than using **create-react-app**. In order to create an app with **Vite** type `npm create vite`

## Create app from zero

Create the folder that will contain all of the source code of the project and within it use npm to install `react` and `react-dom`, just run `npm i react react-dom`

3 items are going to be created inside the project folder:
- A `/node_modules` folder 
- A `package.json` file
- A `package-lock.json` file 

Then you need to create this other items:
- The `/src` folder (This contains all the source code of the app)
	- An `index.js` file inside of it (This is the entrypoint of the app)
	- The `/components` folder inside of it (This contains all of the components that are going to be used in multiple pages or screens)
		- An `App.js` file inside of it (This is the file that will contain all of the routes of the app, it's basically the second entrypoint, that will execute it's contents after `index.js`. It's the first component that is going to be rendered in the screen)
	- The `/styles` folder inside of it (This contains all of the global stylesheets to be applied to the components)
		- An `global.scss` file inside of it (This will contain all of the SASS variables to be used in other stylesheets)
- The `/public` folder (contains public files that wants to be shared with the outside world)
	- An `index.html` file inside of it (This contains all of the html meta tags that will wrap all of the other tags generated by **React** as an SPA framework)

The content of the `index.js` file must be the following:

```TSX
import React form 'react';
import ReactDom from 'react-dom';
import App from './components/App';

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementbyId('app'));

```

The content of `App.js` file must be the following: 
```TSX
import '../styles/global.scss';
import React from 'react';

const App = () => {
	return (
		<h1>Hello world!<h1/>
	);
}

export default App;
```

The content of the `index.html` file must be the following:
- Just type the snippet `html:5` followed by the tab key and the content that you need will be generated.
- The content should look as the following:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html> 
<html lang="en"> 
	<head> 
		<meta charset="UTF-8"> 
		<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge"> 
		<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> 
		<title>React shop</title>
	</head>
	<body> 
		<div id="app"></div> 
	</body> 
</html>
```

Run the following commands in order to install some dependencies:
- All of the **Babel** needed modules
	- `npm install @babel/core @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react`
- All of the **Webpack** needed modules
	- `npm install webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server`
- Some loader modules and plugin modules that are needed
	- `npm install babel-loader html-loader html-webpack-plugin`
- Css loaders, plugins and other modules:
	- `npm install mini-css-extract-plugin css-loader sass-loader style-loader sass -D`

Create the following files in your project's folder:
- A `.babelrc` file at the root of the project's folder. The content is the following:
```json
{
	"presets": [
		"@babel/preset-env",
		"@babel-preset-react"
	]
}
```
- A `webpack.config.js` file at the root of the project's folder. The content is the following:
```JavaScript
const path = require('path');
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');
const MiniCssExtractPlugin = require('mini-css-extract-plugin');
module.exports = {
	entry: './src/index.js',
	output: {
		path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
		filename: 'bundle.js'
	},
	mode: 'development',
	resolve: {
		extensions: ['.js', '.jsx'],
		alias: {
			'@components': path.resolve(__dirname, 'src/components'),
			'@containers': path.resolve(__dirname, 'src/containers'),
			'@styles': path.resolve(__dirname, 'src/styles'),
			'@icons': path.resolve(__dirname, 'src/assets/icons'),
			'@logos': path.resolve(__dirname, 'src/assets/logos')
		}
	},
	module: {
		rules: [
			{
				test: /\.(js|jsx)$/,
				exclude: /node_modules/,
				use: [
					{
						loader: 'babel-loader'
					}
				]
			},
			{
				test: /\.html$/,
				exclude: /node_modules/,
				use: [
					{
						loader: 'html-loader'
					}
				] 
			},
			{
				test: /\.s[ac]ss$/i,
				exclude: /node_modules/,
				use: [
					'style-loader',
					'css-loader',
					'sass-loader'
				]
			},
			{
				test: /\.(jpeg|jpg|png|webp|svg|gif)$/,
				type: 'asset'
			}
		],
		plugins: [
			new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
				template: './public/index.html',
				filename: './index.html'
			}),
			new MiniCssExtractPlugin({
				filename: '[name].css'
			})
		],
		devServer: {
			contentBase: path.join(__dirname, 'dist'),
			compress: true,
			port: 3005,
		}
	}
}
```

Add the following script commands inside the `package.json` file:
```json
"scripts": {
	"start": "webpack serve --open",
	"build": "webpack --mode production"
}
```

To run your project run `npm run start`
